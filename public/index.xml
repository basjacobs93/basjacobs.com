      <description>Inspired by this blog post, I got interested in pen plotters and computer generated art. I liked the minimalist pieces of art a plotter could create, resembling a human hand doodling on a piece of paper. A lot of examples of this art can be found on Twitter at #plottertwitter. By far the most used plotter on Twitter is the AxiDraw, but since I didnâ€™t want to spend over 400 euros and I liked the prospect of assembling something myself, I decided to buy the EleksDraw which was around 100 euros and came completely unassembled.</description>
