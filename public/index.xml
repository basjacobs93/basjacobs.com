      <description>I wanted a logo for my blog. Something kind of personal, but abstract; preferably something that could be drawn with a single path. I decided to download an elevation map of the Netherlands (where I live) to somehow use a plot of that data as my logo. I thought it would be nice to generate a side view and smooth it. In this short post I will discuss how I did it.</description>

      <description>Inspired by this blog post, I got interested in pen plotters and computer generated art. I liked the minimalist pieces of art a plotter could create, resembling a human hand doodling on a piece of paper. A lot of examples of this art can be found on Twitter at #plottertwitter. By far the most used plotter on Twitter is the AxiDraw, but since I didnâ€™t want to spend over 400 euros and I liked the prospect of assembling something myself, I decided to buy the EleksDraw which was around 100 euros and came completely unassembled.</description>
