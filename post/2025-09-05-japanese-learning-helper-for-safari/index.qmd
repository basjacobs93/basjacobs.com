I vibe-coded a Safari extension that helps me practice Japanese while I am browsing the web. Find it [here](https://github.com/basjacobs93/japanese-learning-helper).

It connects to WaniKani to translate words of your level. It can translate a fixed set of nouns, all your WaniKani words, or full sentences. You can select the percentage of sentences it should translate.
It is still a bit buggy, but it works for me. It is fun how easy it now is to create something like this!
